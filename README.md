## Installation

Make sure you have matplotlib installed if you want to use the plotmap.py file.

You should be able to install it by typing

```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

If it isn't working, here's a [link to the official installation tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html).
